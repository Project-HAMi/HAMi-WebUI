The platform supports detailed views for tasks and GPUs, enabling teams to monitor resource consumption effectively.

- **Resource Overview:** Provides a comprehensive view of all resources, including node and GPU usage. Quickly assess the status of all nodes and GPUs.
- **Node Management:** Explore detailed node information, including node status, resource usage, and availability.
- **GPU Management:** Visualize the GPU usage on each node, providing detailed insights into the allocation and usage of compute power and memory.
- **Task Management:** Track tasks and their resource consumption. View task creation times, status, GPU allocations, and more.
